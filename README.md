# Azure Cloud Architecture for Hosting Local Ltda.
This project was developed as part of my Data Science Certificate at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. The objective was to design a Cloud Architecture for the hospitality industry, particularly for a hypothetical platform similar to Airbnb that aimed to leverage the power of cloud computing to optimize resource allocation, enhance operational efficiency, and elevate customer engagement through personalized recommendations.
